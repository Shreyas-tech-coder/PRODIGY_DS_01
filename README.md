📊 PRODIGY_DS_01 – Visualizing Population Distribution (Bar Chart & Histogram)

✅ Task Objective
Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable.
In this task, I chose to visualize the population distribution of countries using real-world data.

📁 Task Description
This project focuses on two visualizations:

Bar Chart – Visualizing the top 10 most populous countries in the year 2022.

Histogram – Showing the distribution of population across all countries (on a log scale).

🗃️ Dataset Used
Population Dataset:
API_SP.POP.TOTL_DS2_en_csv_v2_38144.csv
(World Bank total population by country)

Country Metadata:
Metadata_Country_API_SP.POP.TOTL_DS2_en_csv_v2_38144.csv

🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
pandas – for data handling

matplotlib & seaborn – for data visualization

warnings – to suppress unnecessary warnings

matplotlib.ticker.FuncFormatter – to format axis labels

📈 Bar Chart Output
Title: Top 10 Most Populous Countries in 2022
Saved As: top_10_population_barchart.png

Shows the top 10 countries by population using a horizontal bar chart.

Axis labels are formatted in billions for better readability.

📉 Histogram Output
Title: Distribution of Country Populations in 2022
Saved As: population_distribution_histogram.png

Represents how population is distributed across all countries.

Log scale applied to handle wide range of population values.

📌 Key Learnings
Handling real-world population datasets with missing values and metadata.

Creating clear and effective visualizations using Seaborn.

Using log scale and axis formatting to improve chart readability.

Exploring insights into global population distribution.

🧠 Conclusion
This task helped enhance my skills in data visualization, data cleaning, and working with real-world datasets. It provided insights into global population trends and visual storytelling using Python.
